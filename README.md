This is a very simple snake clone made in C with raylib.

To build it, you can use the `build.sh` script (of course, you do need raylib). Then you can run the "eel" file (without the .c in the end) that will be created to play. Alternatively, you can just run `gcc -lraylib eel.c` which is what the script does anyway, or just use any other C compiler. I probably didn't even need to explain any of this since i don't think anyone who doesn't already know how to build a C program (or anyone for that matter) will see this lol

I named it "eel" because eels are **ray**-finned fish (**ray**lib get it??? im so funny /s) and they kinda look like snakes. I also changed the colors so it kinda looks like an eel in the water if you use your imagination real hard.
